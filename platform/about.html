        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <br>
        <ol>
        <li>Employees post the Job offers</li>
        <li>Job seekers contact the employee and sends resume</li>
        <li>Employees refer candidates to HR through their <b>ERP</b></li>
        <li>Candidates are contacted by HR</li>
        <li>If selected, the employee gets the bonus and optionally awards a percentage to candidate</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h1>What is an ERP?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>According to Wikipedia, an <b>Employee Referral Program</b> is an internal recruitment method employed by organizations to identify potential candidates from their existing employees' social networks. An employee referral scheme encourages a company's existing employees to select and recruit the suitable candidates from their social networks. As a reward, the employer typically pays the referring employee a referral bonus. Recruiting candidates using employee referral is widely acknowledged as being the most cost effective and efficient recruitment method to recruit candidates and as such, employers of all sizes, across all industries are trying to increase the volume of recruits through this channel.</p>

        <h1>Why you should apply with an employee referral?</h1><br>
        <p><b>The numbers don't lie!</b> Gerry Crispin co-founded a non-profit, TalentBoard, to better define and measure the Candidate Experience. In his presentation, he presented some startling numbers on hiring, and the effect of employee referrals that came from the Candidate Experience Award.</p>

        <p>The Candidate Experience Award process is a competition, but it is also designed to provide every organization that chooses to participate some confidential and specific feedback on how they can improve their candidate experience.</p>

        <p>Gerry gave the following typical example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>180 applications for every open position</li>
            <li>4 employee referrals will be submitted</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Approximately, half of all candidates are screened out or deemed unqualified for the position which leaves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>90 applications</li>
            <li>2 employee referrals</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>5 candidates will be interviewed including the 2 employee referrals.</b></p>

        <p>If you apply and an employee referred you for the position, 50% chance of getting an interview and you have a 20% chance of getting hired.</p>

        <p>If you do not have an employee referral, you have a 3% chance of getting an interview and only 1.2% chance of getting hired.</p>

        <h1>Why you should refer?</h1><br>
        <p>There are plenty of positive reasons to refer a friend to a job at your company. You can help your employer out in times of need, which benefits the business as a whole. You will also be helping a friend and simply doing a good deed. You may also generate a sense of goodwill from the referred friend, who may return the favor in the future, enhancing your career. In fact, research shows that people who invest in developing proteges – perhaps by referring them to jobs – have better rates of career progression than those who don’t. The goodwill that you generate by referring a friend may actually be paid back in a way that accelerates your own career progression. It’s kind of a you-scratch-their-back-and-they’ll-scratch-yours situation. If all of that isn’t enough incentive for you, then consider that many employers also offer rewards for referring friends to the company.</p>
